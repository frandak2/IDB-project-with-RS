# Validation

The traditional method for validation of LandTrendr segmentation and derived disturbance maps is the TimeSync application ([paper](https://larse.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/larse/files/pub_pdfs/Cohen_etal_2010.pdf)). It was developed as a companion to LandTrendr and follows the same spectral-temporal vertex and segmentation framework.

Please see this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/eMapR/TimeSync-Legacy) for all the files and instructions you need to get source data from Google Earth Engine and run the desktop Legacy version of the application.
